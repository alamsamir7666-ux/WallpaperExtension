 * model: a home is not one grid but a stack of titled section rows, each
 * with its own pagination.
 *
 * A section is a query preset: [filters] speaks the host vocabulary
 * documented on [Filters] (`category`, `sorting`, `order`, `seed`); the
 * host translates it into its own query pipeline and keeps ownership of
 * content ratings (the user's SFW setting always applies on top). Keys the
 * host does not understand are ignored, exactly like the filter sheet.
 *
 * Implementations should be cheap and offline — the host calls
 * [WallpaperProvider.sections] on every feed start.
