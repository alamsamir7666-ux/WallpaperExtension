/**
 * Provider-agnostic filter selections: selected values grouped by key.
 *
 * The host UI renders filter chips from values the provider (or the app,
 * for built-ins) understands, packs the selection into a [Filters] and
 * passes it to [WallpaperProvider.search]. Each provider documents its own
 * keys — unknown keys are ignored by that provider, and the host treats
 * the whole object as opaque. Example:
 * `Filters.of("categories" to "anime", "purity" to "110")`.
 *
 * ## Host vocabulary
 *
 * The app's browse UI speaks a fixed vocabulary of keys and values. A
 * provider that understands them slots into the shared filter sheet
 * without any bespoke UI; anything else it declares would need its own
 * rendering (V2 territory):
 *
 * - `"query"` — free text; also mirrored into the [WallpaperProvider.search]
 *   `query` parameter, so this key is rarely needed inside filters,
 * - `"category"` — `"general"` / `"anime"` / `"people"` (multi-select),
 * - `"purity"` — `"sfw"` / `"sketchy"` (multi-select; the host never
 *   requests `"nsfw"` in V1 — it drops that value before calling),
 * - `"sorting"` — `"toplist"` / `"date"` / `"random"` / `"relevance"`,
 * - `"order"` — `"desc"` / `"asc"`,
 * - `"seed"` — a random-sort stabilizer (single value; the host generates
 *   one per feed session).
 *
 * Providers ignore whatever they cannot express; e.g. an API without
 * category buckets simply never reads `"category"`.
